# dkLabs_Database
This project creates a website that keeps track of the instruments status and members work of DK Labs, a research 
department of Lewis Uinversity. I was able to take advantage of my knowledge of database design and SQL to create, populate, 
and maintain a working directory for the lab.

This website is designed to be navigated throught the main_page.html file.
